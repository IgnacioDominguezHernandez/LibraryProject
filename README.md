<p>Project executed for the 'Acceso a Datos' (Data Access or Backend-Frontend Data Integration) course as part of the **DAM** 
studies (Cross-Platform Application Development), completed over a three-month period. This initiative represents a full-stack development endeavor, 
integrating a **MongoDB** database with a **Node.js** and **Express** backendâ€”enhanced with **Morgan** for logging and **CORS** for cross-domain requests. 
The **Angular** frontend is developed with **TypeScript**, demonstrating the seamless integration of data from server to UI, a key aspect of modern web applications. 
The project exemplifies practical application of these technologies in creating responsive and interactive user experiences.</p>
